## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic Javascript properties

### Continued development

There are so many things which I have to continue improve in this site like adding a refresh/reset button, improving background on small viewport, deleting saved entries and saving saved entries on local storage. I am still amature in these fields so I will continue developing them and improve this webpage later.I will also try to learn more semantic HTML tags and Javascript and efficiently use them to make the code more clean and developer friendly.
